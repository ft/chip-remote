To build the program:

    % make all

The result will be in "./build/cdce-remote".

To generate the source-code documentation:

    % make apidocs

The result will be in "./apidocs/index.html".

To run the project's test-suite:

    % make test

To install the program and all scheme modules to `/usr/local', run
the following with appropriate access (probably root):

    # make install


If you do not want to install the program, but use it from its build
directory, you can do that. There is a helper target that will generate
a simple shell script `cdce-remote-wrapper', that you can use instead
of the real program. It takes care of setting everything up so that will
work without problems. To generate the script do:

    % cd build
    % make inbuildexecscript
