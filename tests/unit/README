Each file from this directory, which matches "*.t" is automatically added as a
test case and run by "make test".

Specifically, the code from these files is fed to an appropriate interpreter
with `%load-path' aimed at the `scheme/' sub-directory of the project's source
tree. Guile's automatic compilation is turned off for all test-suite scripts.
