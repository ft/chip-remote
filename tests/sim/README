Every *.scm file in here is a scheme script that is run by the chip-remote
interpreter which itself is called be the board simulation program boardsimu,
located in the devsimu subdirectory of the project.

The idea is to have a software-simulated control board, to which we can connect
and try stuff out. Perfect for automated tests.

See the `simple-version.scm' script for a brief idea about how to do that.
