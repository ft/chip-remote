      This sets the maximum input line size for the RCCEP protocol
      implemented by the firmware.

config MAX_PROTOCOL_TOKENS
    int "Maximum Number of Tokens in Protocol Parser"
    default 16
    help
      The RCCEP parser implemented by the chip-remote firmware is
      completely static from a memory allocation point of view. This
      setting specifies the maximum number of tokens, the protocol
      parser can handle for any given line of protocol input. If
      increased, you likely want to increase CONFIG_INPUT_BUFFER_SIZE
      as well.
