;; When proper care has been taken to implement the second-level access module
;; for any given device, often the code required for third-level access can be
;; very much generated on the fly, because the pattern in the common case is
;; always the same: You read a register from the controlled device, change that
;; original register value using the second-level API, and then write the
;; amended register value back to the device.
;;
;; The ‘define-bit-field-frontends’ macro from the (chip-remote level-3) module
;; expands into function definitions of exactly that kind. And when a
;; configuration bit-field is limited to a single register, then that just
;; works.
;;
;; Still, filling the table that provides ‘define-bit-field-frontends’ macro
;; with the information it needs to expand into useful code, is rather boring.
;; The functions that frontends are needed for are in the second-level access
;; module, and the corresponding register-address variable (defined in the
;; registers module for the device) can be derived from the second-level code
;; as well.
;;
;; So what this script does it *reading* scheme expressions from the source
;; code file that houses the second-level module. Then it traverses through the
;; source code to find the first-level access functions used, from which the
;; corresponding register address can be derived. That course of action also
;; allows the script to find out the argument list for the second-level
;; functions. Without that, no sensible third-level code could be generated.
;;
;; Using that approach, the author of the support for a new target device only
;; has to implement a ‘write-register’ function, a ‘read-register’ functions
;; and front-ends for functionality that does not fall within the common case.
;; In particular, that would be frontends for setting bit-fields that span
;; across multiple registers.
