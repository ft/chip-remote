# This file  is used by the ‘standalone’ target  (and there  for the shell
# script tools/make-standalone) as well as the ‘tools/dev-env’ POSIX shell
# snippet to offer  full operation without having to  install the required
# dependencies to the host system.

# Repository specification for standalone operation. The table format is:
#
#     type   URL   subdirectory   path-addition
#
# Type can  be "scm" and "bin"  to extend either guile's  load-path or the
# execution environment's  PATH. The  URL can be  relative to  the current
# branch's remote's  URL or  an absolute URL  of itself.  The subdirectory
# token specifies the name of  the cloned repository inside the standalone
# directory.  The path-addition  part specifies  the directory  inside the
# cloned repository that is added to the respective environment variables.

# The system still requires a full Guile development environment. The host
# type lines allow the initialisation to check for required host tools.
# The format for these lines is:
#
#     type   program   debian-package
#
# I won't bother suggesting packages for  all manners of host systems. De-
# velopers will know what to do.
